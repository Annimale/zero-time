    "aboutUsBody": "Zero Time is not just a watch store, it is the dream come true of two friends passionate about watchmaking: Aivan and Towers. The Zero Time story began in a small city apartment, where Aivan and Towers used to meet to talk about their shared passion for high-end watches. After years of discussions, research and savings, they decided to turn their passion into a business. In 2015, they founded Zero Time with the goal of offering a unique shopping experience for watch enthusiasts in their community. The early days were difficult. They worked long hours, managing everything from product selection to customer service. But their dedication and love for what they did kept them going. Over time, Zero Time became a popular destination for watch lovers in the city. The store not only offered a wide range of watches from prestigious brands, but also a welcoming atmosphere and expert knowledge that customers appreciated. In the years that followed, Zero Time continued to grow and expand. They opened an online store to reach a wider audience and began organizing events and product launches to engage the local watch community. Today, Zero Time is recognized as one of the leading high-end watch stores in the region. Although they have grown, Aivan and Towers remain committed to their original vision of delivering an exceptional experience to their customers and sharing their passion for watchmaking with the world. From humble beginnings in a small apartment to becoming a benchmark in the industry, Zero Time's story is a testament to the power of dedication, hard work and passion for what you do.",
